## 🚦 Workflow Status Indicators

### GitHub Actions Status Badges

Add to your README.md:
```markdown
![Chrome Web Store Deployment](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gofaster/workflows/Chrome%20Web%20Store%20Deployment/badge.svg)
![CI](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gofaster/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)
```

### Status Meanings

| Status | Meaning | Action Required |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| ✅ Success | Deployment completed | Monitor Chrome Web Store |
| ❌ Failure | Deployment failed | Check logs, fix issues |
| 🟡 In Progress | Currently running | Wait for completion |
| ⏸️ Cancelled | Manually stopped | Restart if needed |

## 📈 Key Metrics to Track

### Deployment Metrics
- **Success Rate:** Target >95%
- **Average Duration:** Typically 5-10 minutes
- **Failure Reasons:** Track common issues

### Extension Metrics (Chrome Web Store)
- **Active Users:** Daily/Weekly active users
- **Ratings:** Average rating and review count
- **Installation Rate:** New installs per day
- **Uninstall Rate:** Monitor for issues

### Performance Metrics
- **Test Pass Rate:** Should be 100%
- **Build Time:** Monitor for increases
- **Package Size:** Keep under Chrome limits

## 🔔 Setting Up Notifications

### GitHub Notifications
1. Go to repository Settings
2. Click "Notifications"
3. Enable "Actions" notifications
4. Choose email/web notifications

### Slack Integration (Optional)
```yaml
# Add to workflow files
- name: Notify Slack
  if: failure()
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    status: failure
    webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

### Email Alerts
GitHub automatically sends emails for:
- Failed workflow runs
- Successful deployments (if configured)
- Security alerts

## 📋 Daily Monitoring Checklist

### Morning Check (5 minutes)
- [ ] Check GitHub Actions for overnight runs
- [ ] Review Chrome Web Store status
- [ ] Check for any user reviews/feedback
- [ ] Verify extension is still live

### Weekly Review (15 minutes)
- [ ] Analyze deployment success rate
- [ ] Review user metrics and feedback
- [ ] Check API quota usage
- [ ] Update documentation if needed

### Monthly Deep Dive (30 minutes)
- [ ] Full metrics analysis
- [ ] Review and rotate credentials
- [ ] Update dependencies
- [ ] Plan upcoming features

## 🚨 Alert Thresholds

Set up monitoring for these critical thresholds:

### Immediate Action Required
- Deployment failure rate >10%
- Extension removed from store
- API quota >90% used
- Critical security vulnerabilities

### Investigation Needed
- Deployment time >15 minutes
- Test failure rate >5%
- User rating drops below 4.0
- Significant drop in active users

### Nice to Know
- New user reviews
- Successful deployments
- Weekly usage reports

## 📊 Creating Custom Dashboards

### GitHub Insights
1. Go to repository "Insights" tab
2. Check "Actions" for workflow analytics
3. Review "Traffic" for repository activity

### Chrome Web Store Analytics
1. Open Developer Dashboard
2. Select your extension
3. View "Statistics" tab
4. Export data for external analysis

### Google Cloud Monitoring
1. Go to Cloud Console
2. Navigate to "Monitoring"
3. Create custom dashboards for API usage

## 🔍 Log Analysis

### GitHub Actions Logs
```bash
# Common log locations to check:
- Setup steps (dependency installation)
- Test execution (bun test output)
- Build process (file copying, zipping)
- Chrome Web Store API calls
- Artifact uploads
```

### Important Log Patterns
```bash
# Success patterns:
"✅ All tests passed"
"Package created successfully"
"Published to Chrome Web Store"

# Failure patterns:
"❌ Test failed"
"Invalid refresh token"
"Extension not found"
"API quota exceeded"
```

## 📱 Mobile Monitoring

### GitHub Mobile App
- Download GitHub mobile app
- Enable push notifications
- Monitor workflow runs on-the-go

### Chrome Web Store Mobile
- Use mobile browser to check store status
- Monitor user reviews and ratings
- Quick response to user feedback

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Monitoring Issues

### GitHub Actions Not Triggering
```bash
# Check:
1. Webhook configuration
2. Branch protection rules
3. Workflow file syntax
4. Repository permissions
```

### Missing Notifications
```bash
# Verify:
1. Email settings in GitHub
2. Notification preferences
3. Spam folder
4. Webhook URLs (if using Slack/Discord)
```

### Inaccurate Metrics
```bash
# Common causes:
1. Timezone differences
2. Caching delays
3. API rate limiting
4. Data export timing
```
